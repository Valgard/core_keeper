# CLAUDE.md — Core Keeper modding (shared)

Parent-level guidance inherited by every Core Keeper mod project under this
directory. Each mod also has its own `CLAUDE.md` with mod-specific detail
(patch targets, classes, build scripts). This file holds **only** what is
true for *all* mods built against Pugstorm's `CoreKeeperModSDK` on this
machine — change it only when an insight is genuinely mod-agnostic.

## Directory layout

- `CoreKeeperModSDK/` — the Pugstorm SDK clone, **shared** by every mod. Its
  own git repo. Mods do not vendor a private SDK copy.
- `<mod-name>/` — one directory per mod, each its own git repo. Currently:
  `disable-durability/`, `faster-talents/`, `item-checklist/`,
  `caveling-divining-rod/`, and `simple-crafting-pool-extender/`.

A mod keeps **every file the Unity Editor generates for it** — `.cs`
sources, `.asmdef`s, the ModBuilderSettings `.asset`, and all `.meta` GUID
carriers — in a `unity/` directory that mirrors the SDK's `Assets/` tree
1:1. Otherwise those files exist only as untracked files inside the shared
SDK clone — one `git clean` or re-clone away from loss.

`utils/link.sh` symlinks that mirror into `CoreKeeperModSDK/Assets/`: one
**directory** symlink for the mod folder — which captures every current and
future Editor-generated file, so nothing has to be wired up by hand — plus
file symlinks for any Assets-level files beside it. The symlinks encode
absolute paths, so they dangle after a worktree switch or repo move;
`utils/build.sh` re-runs `link.sh` on every build so this self-heals.

## Required setup (per machine / per SDK clone)

- **Unity Editor `6000.0.59f2`** — exact patch version, pinned in the SDK's
  `ProjectVersion.txt` (the SDK `README.md` is one patch behind — do not trust
  it). Install via Unity Hub with **Linux Build Support (Mono)** and, on
  macOS, **Windows Build Support (Mono)**.
- **`CoreKeeperModSDK` clone** — the wizard's "Create New Mod" + "Update Game
  Files" must be run once.
- The Unity Editor **locks the project** — it must be closed during any
  `-batchmode` build.
- **`corekeeper-patch` applied to the installed game's `PugMod.Loader.dll`** —
  required on macOS / CrossOver hosts. Two IL patches: (Patch 1) fixes the
  Wine `Directory.Delete` failure on stale `ModLoader/<ModName>/Scripts/`,
  (Patch 2) forces `CultureInfo.DefaultThreadCurrentUICulture =
  InvariantCulture` so Roslyn doesn't fail compiles by chasing the missing
  `de-DE` satellite assembly. Every Core Keeper update reverts the DLL to
  stock — re-apply after each update. Rationale + canonical commands in
  the `corekeeper-roslyn-locale-bug` memory.

## SDK quirks (apply to every mod)

### macOS Editor — Steamworks compile errors
A fresh SDK clone fails to compile on a macOS Editor host with
`CS0246: ... 'Steamworks'`. The SDK ships Steamworks DLLs gated to Windows/
Linux Editors only; neither loads on macOS. Fix: enable
`Assets/Plugins/CoreKeeperModSDK/Facepunch.Steamworks.Posix.dll.meta` for
`OS: AnyOS`. One-time per SDK clone — see
`disable-durability/docs/research/macos-sdk-steamworks-fix.md`.

### Manifest fields — edit the `.asset`, not `ModManifest.json`
A mod's `ModManifest.json` is **build-generated** from its ModBuilderSettings
`.asset` (`unity/<Mod>/<Mod>.asset`, the `ModMetadata` block: `name`,
`displayName`, `requiredOn`, `dependencies`, …). The build writes the real
manifest (with computed file GUIDs + AssetBundle entries) into the output dir;
the loader reads *that* via `JsonUtility.FromJson<ModMetadata>`. A hand-authored
repo `ModManifest.json` is the **wrong schema** (`name_id`/`version`/
`modDependencies` keys are silently ignored on load) and is read by nothing —
do **not** keep one. So edit manifest fields directly in the `.asset` YAML's
`metadata:` block:
- The SDK mod-settings Editor UI is unreliable for `displayName` (cannot be set
  through the GUI) and `requiredOn` (choosing "Client and Server" writes `-1`
  / "Everything"). Set `displayName:` and `requiredOn: 3` (ClientAndServer)
  directly in the `.asset`.
- Mod dependencies (e.g. CoreLib) live in the `.asset`'s `dependencies:` list
  (`- modName: CoreLib` / `required: 1`) and flow into the built manifest.

The published mod.io listing does **not** read the manifest either: profile name
← `metadata.displayName` (fallback `metadata.name`) — so the human title
"Item Checklist" can differ from the internal identity "ItemChecklist"; summary
← `MOD_SUMMARY` env, version + changelog ← `CHANGELOG.md`, modId ←
`<Mod>_modio.asset`, version tag(s) ← `CK_GAME_VERSION` env — a
**space-separated list** of one or more game versions, each published as its
own compatibility tag (all in `utils/CLIPublishHelper.cs`).

### Runtime asmdef from the wizard
The "Create New Mod" wizard emits the mod's runtime `.asmdef` already
populated with the full game-DLL reference set (`Pug.Other.dll`,
`0Harmony.dll`, `PugMod.SDK.Runtime.dll`, …). Mod code compiles against game
types and Harmony out of the box — no manual reference editing is needed.

## Runtime constraints (apply to every mod's code)

### RoslynCSharp sandbox — no System.IO
Mods ship `Scripts/*.cs` and are compiled at load time inside a default-deny
sandbox. `System.IO.*`, `System.Diagnostics.Process`, reflection-emit and
similar BCL surface fail the compile on first reference (`mod load error:
CompileFailed`). Either avoid those APIs (hardcode what would otherwise live
in a runtime `config.json`) or set `skipSafetyChecks: true` in
`ModManifest.json` to disable the sandbox entirely — acceptable for
personal-use mods, at the cost of whatever the safety checks guarded.

### Burst-compiled systems are not Harmony-patchable
A DOTS system whose `OnUpdate` is Burst-compiled cannot be intercepted by
Harmony. Call `BurstDisabler.DisableBurstForSystem<TSystem>()` in
`IMod.Init()` to move the system off Burst *before* the patch needs to bind.

### IMod lifecycle
`IMod` (namespace `PugMod`) has five methods: `EarlyInit`, `Init`,
`ModObjectLoaded`, `Shutdown`, `Update`. `[HarmonyPatch]` classes are
**auto-discovered** by the loader — no manual `Harmony.PatchAll()` call. The
bootstrap `IMod` class and the patch class are conventionally separate files.

### Editor-only asmdef
`ModBuilder` / `ModBuilderSettings` are editor-only. A combined runtime+editor
asmdef cannot reference an editor-only one, so a CLI build helper (for
`unity -batchmode -executeMethod`) needs its own `*.Editor.asmdef`.

## macOS / CrossOver — distribution & loader

Fake-ID dev install, the incompatible-mod dialog, `state.json`/`config.json`
surfaces, and CrossOver/Wine specifics — see @docs/macos-crossover-loader.md.

## Build pattern (shared `utils/`)

The shared `utils/` build/publish scripts and the `.envrc` inheritance chain
are documented in `README.md` (§ Build & install). Human-facing build/publish
instructions live there.

## mod.io publishing (applies to every mod)

Publishing flow, dependency sync, and the three mod IDs — see @docs/publishing.md.

## Conventions

- **Personal-use, non-commercial only** (Pugstorm EULA).
- Documentation files (`CLAUDE.md`, `README.md`, `docs/`) are English; chat
  answers are German.
- Each mod is an independent git repo with its own `CLAUDE.md` for
  mod-specific detail.
